## Hi there, I'm Tobias Lino!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on SONDA
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- 🗑️ For now, I'm studying models of garbage collectors.

I'm looking to understand how neural networks are used for simulations of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamics, but that is for another day.
